    Args:
        size: A tuple (x_size, y_size) specifying the grid dimensions.
        resolution: A tuple (dx, dy) specifying the grid spacing or a string 'auto' for automatic resolution.
        fixedCondtions: A function that enforces boundary conditions on the potential grid.

    # wow Gemini Docstrings kinda magic and good. Also rotationless solver
