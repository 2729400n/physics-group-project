# Introduction

## Problem

Electro-static problems have always been difficult infact they to

Solve electro-static boundary problem to acquire steady state solutions.

## Aims

* Solve electrosattic problems using ODES.
* Solve some problems analytically.
* Solve problems numerically.
* Show it is **_much_** easier solve numerically
* Show that **_not all_** problems can be solved analytially
* Show thos problems can be solved numerically
