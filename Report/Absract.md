# Abstract

Electro-static problems are a differential set of problems in physics. These involve solving PDEs which can be impossible to solve analytically. This report shows how they can be effectivley solved with  use of numerical methods. This report will be heavily python oriented for ease of access to cater to a less programming savy audience
